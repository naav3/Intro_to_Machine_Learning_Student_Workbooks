(LSA is often called LSI - Latent Semantic Indexing). The idea of LSA is that it can generate \"concepts\" in the text. These concepts are found by looking at which terms occur in which documents - documents that have the same terms repeated are likely related to the same concept; other documents that share other words with those documents are likely on the same concept as well.  \n",

    "Now comes the word2vec model - instead of taking our clean data and counting it to extract features, we can train our Word2Vec model with our cleaned up data and the output of that model is our set of features. This will have Word2Vec do its magic behind the scenes and perform the training. W2V works in one of two ways, which are roughly opposites of each other, when doing this training:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Continuous Bag of Words: looks at a window around each target word to try to predict surrounding words.\n",
    "<li> Skip-Gram: looks at words surrounding target to try to predict it. \n",

    "\n",
    "The embeddings that we are generating are vectors that represent the words in our text. We can look at the embeddings for a word to see what they look like, but they aren't comprehensible to humans. Our count vectors or the td-idf calculations we made previously are also embeddings, those are just far more simple. Word2Vec will generate embeddings that attempt to group words that are similar together in multidimensional space. We can look at a simple example in 2D:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Similarity](images/similarity.png \"Similarity\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The values here aren't calculated, they are chosen arbitrarily, but each word is represented here in two dimensions - x and y. Words that are similar in meaning should be close to each other in the vector representation, such as \"King\" and \"Queen\". Words that are not similar should be far apart, such as \"King\" and \"Rutabaga\". The embeddings that word2vec will generate from our data as a result of the training below will aim to represent each word in 200 dimension space. We feed the word2vec model our tokens, and it will generate a N-dimension vector for each token. We can use comparisons in this N dimensional space to determine how similar two words are. "

    "\n",
    "We've mentioned that the word2vec model we are making is a neural network. Neural networks, as we'll see later, have an architecture, or basically a size and design. The details don't matter too much to us yet, but one thing that we can change when determing our model in word2vec is that architecture - we can choose between CBOW and Skip-Gram. These two options are roughly opposites of each other. The details of how they work and how they differ are neural network details, so we'll set those details aside for now.\n",

    "#### Which to Use?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, the real answer is our favorite one - test and choose the best. In general:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Skip Gram tends to work well with small amount of data and is found to represent rare words well.\n",
    "<li> CBOW is normally faster and has better representations for more frequent words.\n",

    "\n",
    "Parameters other than the ones we have listed here can be tweaked, but we'll somewhat ignore them for now, we're ok with the defaults. The \"sg\" parameter is the one that controls the architecture - 1 is skip-gram, 0 is CBOW."

    "## Using Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that Word2Vec allows us to do is to look at the similarity of words. This similarity is calculated via the cosine distance of the vectors. Cosine similarity is a technique to calculate the distance between two vectors - smaller distance, more similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Cosine Similarity](images/cosine_sim.png \"Cosine Similarity\" )\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vectors are derived by in the training process, these similarity calculations are pretty easy and quick. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> the similarites here are calculated by the values derived from our trained model. So they are based on the relationships in our text. Word2Vec and other NLP packages also commonly have pretrained models that can be downloaded that are based on large amounts of text. Words may be represented very differently in those vs whatever we train here - the more data we have, the more consistent they'll be; the more \"unique\" our text is, the more different it will be. If we were, for example, working in a specific domain such as patent law, we could use a large amount of patent law text to train a model that would be more consistent with our domain. Or, perhaps more likely, we could use a pretrained model that has been created with massive amounts of training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the similarity of different words, we can measure that similarity in a couple of ways - lexical and semantic, that we mentioned before. Here, the model is looking at semantic similarity, the \"meaning\" of each word, in the context of our text, is being compared and the most similar words are returned. Note that we can only calculate similarity here for words that we have in our vocabulary. This is one place where large language models like chat GPT have a massive advantage, their vocabulary is huge. "

    "We can take our actual data now and transform it through the Word2Vec model that we've made. This will generate our smaller feature set that we can build our models from, one of the things that the MeanEmbeddingVectorizer does is to collapse the data down to those 200 dimensions in the vector. Our dataset is spit out the other end, each row of text is now represented by a single vector of those 200 dimensions of our embedding values from the word2vec model (the columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> if this is confusing, please ignore it, this is a bit of a tangent. The meanembeddingvectorizer thing is needed to \"flatten\" our data down from 200D to 1D for each token. This is because our models can only dal with data that is in that format (instances x features). We can't have a 200D vector for each token, we need to collapse it down to a single value. Later, when we look at neural networks, we'll see models with differnet architectures that can accomadate data that is multidimensional like this. That's one of the reasons that neural networks are so powerful, they can accomadate data that is multidimensional, so something like an image can be treated like an image, not just a bunch of pixels."

    "## Pretrained Word2Vec Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When we do the intial training of the word2vec model (not when we are making final predictions), we are using our corpus to generate the space and the embeddigns for all of our tokens. We can also download a pretrained model, that already has the N-dimensional space defined (when it was trained on some different data), and use that to generate our embeddings. This is a common practice, and can be a good way to get started. Gensim has several models that have been trained on varying amounts of data, they are listed here: https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim-data along with several other datasets that we could use to train a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The differences with using this pretrained model (or an existing corpus below) are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Above, when training word2vec with our data, we used our corpus to generate the space in which the tokens are placed, then calculate those embeddings for each token. \n",
    "<li> With a pretrained model, we are using the space that was generated by the model that was trained on some other data, then placing our tokens in that space. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we are using some text from wikipedia (like the second example), the space in which embeddings are made is defined by the text in wikipedia. So the \"closeness\" in meaning of words is based on what is in that corpus. We then take our tokens and calculate their embeddings in that space. The big advantage to this is someone else can train a model on lots of data, which hopefully generates a better understanding of the relationships between words, and we can then just score our words on those scales. This approach is common in large models, like text processing or image recognition, where the training load can be too large for \"regular folk\". We can also take these trained models and \"customize\" them to our data, we'll look at that with image recognition at the end of the semester. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use a Twitter Trained Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We can try using a pretrained model that was trained on Twitter data. This model has been pretrained, so it already knows how to represent words, we will then feed it all of our tokens, and it will generate the embeddings for us."

    "## NLP and Me!\n",
    "\n",
    "As we see with things like chatGPT and the assortment of voice assistants, NLP is currently exploding in both capability and prevelence. Those other models are based on these concepts, but there are a few key differences that help those tools be more powerful:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> They are trained on much larger datasets. Very, very, very large datasets. In NLP specifically, this helps because it can help address the problem with us having so many words, many of which aren't used super often - i.e. the fact that there are a lot of words that don't occur together in the same sentence. If the training data is massive (e.g. \"the internet\"), we massively reduce the impact of this problem, as we see each word many times. \n",
    "<li> The use of neural networks, in particular recurrant neural networks (RNNs) that are able to deal with data as a sequence, and \"remember\" other parts of a sequence of words. This helps these models understand the context of a sentence, and the relationships between words.\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Of note with neural networks, especially those using massive training data sets, is that the first layers of the model can perform equivalent data prep work that we've done here. So the model is more able to deal with data in its raw form, and doesn't need to be preprocessed as much separately, in advance. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Manual intervention is used, humans provide examples of convesation, define labels, and evaluate the quality of the model's work. You may have heard news of Kenyans being paid low wages to label data for these models.\n",
    "<li> Other model types are used to help, such as reinforcement learning. Responses that are good are rewarded, and those that are bad are punished. This helps the model learn what is good and what is bad. This is particularly useful for generative models, such as chatGPT.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, this stuff is actively being developed right now, and the more advanced the tool, the more likely we are to see innovation or specific interventions to correct issues. The foundations we have looked at here are the building blocks of that work. "
